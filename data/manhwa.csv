Shavonne, an aspiring young writer, is no exception: he struggles to hold a job, his love life is in shambles, and it seems like he even has a stalker. But the bleakness of his days changes when he meets his next-door neighbor, Lewellyn.  Lewellyn is charming and undoubtedly handsome, but he is rather eccentric. Day after day, he sits on the staircase and peels onions, and his wealth is too suspicious for an Ira Street resident. Despite the warning signs, Shavonne accepts a dinner invitation from Lewellyn. However, during the candlelit dinner, Shavonne stumbles upon a mutilated corpse—later discovered as evidence of the Ira Street murderer's latest crime.  As Shavonne tiptoes around Lewellyn trying to save his own skin, strange things begin to happen, and he wonders if Lewellyn is his enemy or the only one truly on his side.
