While Katou dreads the inevitable return to Gantz, Kei finds himself living for the sole purpose of carrying out these missions. Thriving in the heat of battle and learning to care about himself and his comrades, Kei faces escalating monstrous threats that begin to bleed out into his normal life outside of Gantz.

As Suzu's one-sided feelings are growing, so is the difference in their ayakashi views: Matsuri considers all ayakashi a threat to his friend, while Suzu is an ayakashi medium—someone who exudes a significant amount of life force compared to the average human—and loves them all despite the risk.  When the two stumble upon a talking white cat named Shirogane, they are unaware that it is a four-hundred-year-old ayakashi known as the King of Ayakashi. He is hell-bent on gaining even more power by devouring Suzu, but as Matsuri swoops in to try and save her by sealing Shirogane's powers, the ayakashi uses a jutsu to turn him into a girl instead!  Matsuri vows to protect Suzu from further harm as her best friend, but he must learn how to act like a girl until his grandfather—a famous wind jutsu exorcist ninja—can undo the jutsu. Meanwhile, Suzu must work out her romantic feelings for Matsuri now that he is no longer a boy. But when Matsuri takes the king as his pet, the future of the two friends seems uncertain.

Out of the seven, Lucky is the only one who lacks his siblings' talent, earning the ire of his equally talented pianist father, Gakuon. Publicly, the Otogami siblings are known as sextuplets due to Lucky's ostracization from the family following their parents' divorce. Because of his mother's subsequent hospitalization, Lucky now lives with his abusive aunt who treats him like a housekeeper. Despite the suffering he has endured, Lucky still loves the piano and plays it whenever he visits his mother in the hospital.  One day, he is surprised to find his mother awake and off her medication. She laments that she was unable to give birth to Lucky as a genius, which saddens him—he does not blame anyone but himself for being a failure. When he seeks her guidance, his mother encourages Lucky to prove to his father that the talentless can also play the piano. This inspires him to take the entrance exam for the prestigious Shibuya Music High School, where his unique, albeit mediocre, playstyle catches the attention of Hideo Dada—his father's former teacher.  After his admission, Lucky finds himself being tutored by Dada alongside a reluctant Ako Furusu—the class representative yearning for vengeance against Gakuon for pushing her pianist mother out of the spotlight.

In the distant past the Farus Di Kanon Empire, now commonly known as the ""Super Empire,"" controlled all 4 solar systems of the Joker Cluster.
